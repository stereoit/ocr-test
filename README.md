# OCRInvoiceBot Project

This project is focused on building the OCRInvoiceBot, an AI agent designed to automate the digitalization of invoices from various formats (PDF, JPG) into structured JSON data.

## Overview

The OCRInvoiceBot aims to streamline invoice processing by leveraging AI, specifically a Large Language Model (LLM), to understand and extract relevant information from invoice documents. The extracted data is then structured according to a predefined JSON schema, making it ready for consumption by downstream systems.

For a detailed description of the agent's architecture, core functionality, and data flow, please refer to the [Agent Specification Document](docs/agent.spec.md).

## Goals

The primary goal of this project is to develop an intelligent agent capable of:
* Accurately extracting data from invoices in PDF and JPG formats.
* Structuring the extracted data into a consistent JSON format.
* Providing interfaces for integration via MCP (Model Context Protocol) and optionally via a REST API.

Further goals regarding specific AI platform integration, performance metrics, and operational details will be added as the project progresses.

## Current Status

This project is currently in the initial development phase. The agent specification has been defined, and the core components are being planned.

## Future Enhancements

This README will be updated with more detailed information, including:
* Instructions on how to build the project.
* Guidelines for running the agent locally.
* Deployment instructions for various AI platforms.
* Contribution guidelines.

We welcome contributions and feedback as the project evolves.
